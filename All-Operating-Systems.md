# All Operating Systems Intallations

## Step 1 Browser

We highly recommend using Google Chrome (This is what your instructor will be using and we highly recommend using the same browser as your instructor)

Download the latest version of [Google Chrome Here][0]

### Browser Alternatives

We understand that people may wish not to use Google based services, if this is the case there are two alternatives that will work for the course

1 - [Brave Browser][1]
2 - [Edge][2]

It is **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT** to note that your instructors will not be able to support when things aren't working in these two browsers and should be considered only for expert users who are extremely comfortable using these browsers.

## Step 2 Discord Desktop Application

You should download the discord app locally to your computer. Please do not use Discord in the browser.

[Download Discord][3]

Once you have the desktop app, join the SDA discord server here:

[https://discord.gg/cqWuUvZwyZ][4]

Ensure that you follow the prompts that discord gives you.

## Step 3 Sign up for a GitHub account

### Use the same email address for steps 3 and 4

You will use GitHub to store your projects and to show them to potential employers.

If you do not have a github account already, sign up for a github account here:
[https://github.com/signup][5]

If you do already have a github account ensure that you can log into it here, if you need to reset your password, now is the time to do it.
[https://github.com/login][6]

## Step 4 Sign up for a GitHub Enterprise Account

### Use the same email address as you did in step 3

At general assembly we use GitHub Enterprise. It works in exactly the same way as Github, but it is a completely seperate system. This is where you'll recieve all of the classwork, homework, and lesson material.

Follow instructions to sign up to github enterprise here:
[Github Enterprise Sign Up Instructions][7]

Make sure you read the note on choosing an appropriate username.

## Step 5 Install Zoom (Remote and in person students)

It's pretty obvious why remote participants need zoom, however it's also beneficial for in-person participants to download it so that you can collaborate on homework and also it may be used during class.

Make sure you download the zoom app on your computer.
[https://zoom.us/download][8]

Ensure you download the correct version for your operating system (Windows, Mac Intel, or Mac Apple Silicon)

## Step 6 Download and Install VS Code

VS Code is where we will write all of our code in class, at home, and for projects.
Download the latest version here:
[https://code.visualstudio.com/download][9]

Ensure that you download the appropriate version for your operating system.

## Step 7 Install Postman

Postman is a tool we will use to test our APIs.

Download and install the latest version here:
[https://www.postman.com/downloads/][10]

Ensure that you download the appropriate version for your operating system.

## Step 8 Docker Desktop

Go to [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/][11] and hover over `download docker desktop` button then choose your operating system.

Install the downloaded file and choose all of the default options.
