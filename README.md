# Software you need to install

Welcome to the SDA Software Engineering Bootcamp Tech setup.

Below there are three installation documents.

Everyone must complete the first installation document as this is applicable to all operating systems.

Once you have completed the first `All Operating Systems` document, move onto either the `Windows Installs`, or `Mac Installs` document.
